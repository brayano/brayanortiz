Boxing, running, cycling, and reading are some of my hobbies. I have run the Pacific Northwest and Southern California Ragnar relay races a few times in total.

I am an outspoken advocate of promoting diversity in the workplace, both in terms of external engagement and internal hiring processes. Currently, I am a member of the LatinX in AI group.

Teaching and mentoring are activities that I consistently seek out. It is fulfilling to play a part in the growth of others. I currently mentor statisticians, data scientists, and data engineers within Amazon and in my professional network.
